# Guten-Tag-Welt
Hello World! (literally "good day world")

Greetings conscious universe!

This is the collection of strings vibrating in the harmonic key of B-man.
Not too long ago (35 years), I was learning PL1 and Pascal on a DEC Eclipse Mini-Computer which had only 64k RAM and about 100 text terminals attached to it. Not very exciting as the kit we have today, but useful enough at the time. Haven't done much programming since, but I'm thinking I'd like to get back into it.

Hope it works out...
